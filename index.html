    <p>My email address, backwards, is <b>moc.liamg@0029htrahddis</b></p>

    <p>I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.qualia.com/">Qualia</a> in San Francisco, California.</p>

    <p>I live at <a href="http://eventhorizon.strikingly.com/">Event Horizon</a> in Berkeley. If you know me, you're always welcome to come stay with me there.</p>

    <p>I have been <a href="https://www.memrise.com/course/1462088/siddharths-egyptian-arabic-studies/">studying Egyptian Arabic</a> since March 2017 and visited Egypt for a week in early June 2017.</p>
